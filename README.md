# Wolf-Pack-Algorithm
This is a demo of the Wolf-Pack-Algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to 12 typical complex function optimization problems.

You can just change the 'f_name' here to see how the algorithm works when applied to different functions.

Attention:

Notice that the functions are not indexed sequentially.But:

F1 F2 F5 F6 F8 F10 F11 F14 F15 F16 F17 F18
